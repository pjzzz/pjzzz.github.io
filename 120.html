<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">would not have come to such a state.</div>
<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">I wasn't sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at Mrs. Dubose's</div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">assessment of the family's mental hygiene. I had become almost accustomed to</div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">hearing insults aimed at Atticus. But this was the first one coming from an adult.</div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">Except for her remarks about Atticus, Mrs. Dubose's attack was only routine.</div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">There was a hint of summer in the air- in the shadows it was cool, but the sun was</div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">warm, which meant good times coming: no school and Dill.</div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">Jem bought his steam engine and we went by Elmore's for my baton. Jem took no</div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">pleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside</div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">me toward home. On the way home I nearly hit Mr. Link Deas, who said, "Look</div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">out now, Scout!" when I missed a toss, and when we approached Mrs. Dubose's</div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times.</div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">She was not on the porch.</div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it, what made him</div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">break the bonds of "You just be a gentleman, son," and the phase of self-conscious</div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">rectitude he had recently entered. Jem had probably stood as much guff about</div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">Atticus lawing for niggers as had I, and I took it for granted that he kept his</div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">temper- he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time,</div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">however, I thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes</div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">he simply went mad.</div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">What Jemdid was something I'd do as a matter of course had I not been under</div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">Atticus's interdict, which I assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies. We</div>

<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">the steps into Mrs. Dubose's front yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said,</div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls, forgetting that if Mrs. Dubose</div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">missed, her girl Jessie probably wouldn't.</div>
<div id="ts_120" class="t s1_120">He did not begin to calmdown until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush</div>
<div id="tt_120" class="t s1_120">Mrs. Dubose owned, until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves. He</div>
<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">bent my baton against his knee, snapped it in two and threw it down.</div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">By that time I was shrieking. Jemyanked my hair, said he didn't care, he'd do it</div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">again if he got a chance, and if I didn't shut up he'd pull every hair out of my head.</div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">I didn't shut up and he kicked me. I lost my balance and fell on my face. Jem</div>
