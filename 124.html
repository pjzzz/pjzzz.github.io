<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">"We're a team, remember?" I said. "Besides, Grover did the fancy flying."</div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s1_124">I thought he was asleep, but he mumbled from the corner, "I was pretty amazing, wasn't I?"</div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">Annabeth and I laughed.</div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">She pulled apart an Oreo, handed me half. "In the Iris message ... did Luke really say </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">nothing?"</div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">I munched my cookie and thought about how to answer. The conversation via rainbow had </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">bothered me all evening. "Luke said you and he go way back. He also said Grover wouldn't fail </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">this time. Nobody would turn into a pine tree."</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">In the dim bronze light of the sword blade, it was hard to read their expressions.</div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">Grover let out a mournful bray.</div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">"I should've told you the truth from the beginning." His voice trembled. "I thought if you </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">knew what a failure I was, you wouldn't want me along."</div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">"You were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia, the daughter of Zeus."</div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">He nodded glumly.</div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">"And the other two half-bloods Thalia befriended, the ones who got safely to camp ..." I </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">looked at Annabeth. "That was you and Luke, wasn't it?"</div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">She put down her Oreo, uneaten. "Like you said, Percy, a seven-year-old half-blood wouldn't </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">have made it very far alone. Athena guided me toward help. Thalia was twelve. Luke was </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">fourteen. They'd both run away from home, like me. They were happy to take me with them. </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">They were ... amazing monster-fighters, even without training. We traveled north from Virginia </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">without any real plans, fending off monsters for about two weeks before Grover found us."</div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">"I was supposed to escort Thalia to camp," he said, sniffling. "Only Thalia. I had strict orders </div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s1_124">from Chiron: don't do anything that would slow down the rescue. We knew Hades was after her, </div>

<div id="tp_124" class="t s1_124">all three of them to safety. It was my fault the Kindly Ones caught up with us. I froze. I got scared </div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">on the way back to camp and took some wrong turns. If I'd just been a little quicker ..."</div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">"Stop it," Annabeth said. "No one blames you. Thalia didn't blame you either."</div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">"She sacrificed herself to save us," he said miserably, "Her death was my fault. The Council </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">of Cloven Elders said so."</div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">"Because you wouldn't leave two other half-bloods behind?" I said. "That's not fair."</div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s1_124">"Percy's right," Annabeth said. "I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for you, Grover. Neither </div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s1_124">would Luke. We don't care what the council says."</div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s1_124">Grover kept sniffling in the dark. "It's just my luck. I'm the lamest satyr ever, and I find the </div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">two most powerful half-bloods of the century, Thalia and Percy."</div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">"You're not lame," Annabeth insisted. "You've got more courage than any satyr I've ever met. </div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s1_124">Name one other who would dare go to the Underworld. I bet Percy is really glad you're here right </div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s1_124">now."</div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s1_124">She kicked me in the shin.</div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">"Yeah," I said, which I would've done even without the kick. "It's not luck that you found </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">Thalia and me, Grover. You've got the biggest heart of any satyr ever. You're a natural searcher. </div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s1_124">That's why you'll be the one who finds Pan."</div>
