<div id="t1_20" class="t s1_20">bus, a sort of warding-off-evil gesture, a clawed hand over my heart, then a shoving movement </div>
<div id="t2_20" class="t s1_20">toward Gabe. The screen door slammed shut so hard it whacked him in the butt and sent him </div>
<div id="t3_20" class="t s1_20">flying up the staircase as if he'd been shot from a cannon. Maybe it was just the wind, or some </div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s1_20">freak accident with the hinges, but I didn't stay long enough to find out.</div>
<div id="t5_20" class="t s1_20">I got in the Camaro and told my mom to step on it.</div>
<div id="t6_20" class="t s1_20">Our rental cabin was on the south shore, way out at the tip of Long Island. It was a little pastel </div>
<div id="t7_20" class="t s1_20">box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes. There was always sand in the sheets and </div>
<div id="t8_20" class="t s1_20">spiders in the cabinets, and most of the time the sea was too cold to swim in.</div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s1_20">I loved the place.</div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s1_20">We'd been going there since I was a baby. My mom had been going even longer. She never </div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s1_20">exactly said, but I knew why the beach was special to her. It was the place where she'd met my </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s1_20">dad.</div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s1_20">As we got closer to Montauk, she seemed to grow younger, years of worry and work </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s1_20">disappearing from her face. Her eyes turned the color of the sea.</div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s1_20">We got there at sunset, opened all the cabin's windows, and went through our usual cleaning </div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s1_20">routine. We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to the seagulls, and munched on blue jelly </div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s1_20">beans, blue saltwater taffy, and all the other free samples my mom had brought from work.</div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s1_20">I guess I should explain the blue food.</div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s1_20">See, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing. They had this fight, which seemed </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s1_20">like a really small thing at the time. But ever since, my mom went out of her way to eat blue. She </div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s1_20">baked blue birthday cakes. She mixed blueberry smoothies. She bought blue-corn tortilla chips </div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s1_20">and brought home blue candy from the shop. This—along with keeping her maiden name, </div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s1_20">Jackson, rather than calling herself Mrs. Ugliano—was proof that she wasn't totally suckered by </div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s1_20">Gabe. She did have a rebellious streak, like me.</div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s1_20">When it got dark, we made a fire. We roasted hot dogs and marshmallows. Mom told me </div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s1_20">stories about when she was a kid, back before her parents died in the plane crash. She told me </div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s1_20">about the books she wanted to write someday, when she had enough money to quit the candy </div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s1_20">shop.</div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s1_20">Eventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind whenever we came </div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s1_20">to Montauk—my father. Mom's eyes went all misty. I figured she would tell me the same things </div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s1_20">she always did, but I never got tired of hearing them.</div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s1_20">"He was kind, Percy," she said. "Tall, handsome, and powerful. But gentle, too. You have his </div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s1_20">black hair, you know, and his green eyes."</div>
<div id="ty_20" class="t s1_20">Mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag. "I wish he could see you, Percy. He </div>
<div id="tz_20" class="t s1_20">would be so proud."</div>
<div id="t10_20" class="t s1_20">I wondered how she could say that. What was so great about me? A dyslexic, hyperactive boy </div>
<div id="t11_20" class="t s1_20">with a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years.</div>
<div id="t12_20" class="t s1_20">"How old was I?" I asked. "I mean ... when he left?"</div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s1_20">She watched the flames. "He was only with me for one summer, Percy. Right here at this </div>
<div id="t14_20" class="t s1_20">beach. This cabin."</div>
