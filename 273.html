<div id="t1_273" class="t s1_273">"You aren't starting that again, are you?" said Atticus one night, when I expressed</div>
<div id="t2_273" class="t s1_273">a stray desire just to have one good look at Boo Radley before I died. "If you are,</div>
<div id="t3_273" class="t s1_273">I'll tell you right now: stop it. I'm too old to go chasing you off the Radley</div>
<div id="t4_273" class="t s1_273">property. Besides, it's dangerous. You might get shot. You know Mr. Nathan shoots</div>
<div id="t5_273" class="t s1_273">at every shadow he sees, even shadows that leave size-four bare footprints. You</div>
<div id="t6_273" class="t s1_273">were lucky not to be killed."</div>
<div id="t7_273" class="t s1_273">I hushed then and there. At the same time I marveled at Atticus. This was the first</div>
<div id="t8_273" class="t s1_273">he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew.</div>
<div id="t9_273" class="t s1_273">And it had happened years ago. No, only last summer- no, summer before last,</div>
<div id="ta_273" class="t s1_273">when... time was playing tricks on me. I must remember to ask Jem.</div>
<div id="tb_273" class="t s1_273">So many things had happened to us, Boo Radley was the least of our fears. Atticus</div>
<div id="tc_273" class="t s1_273">said he didn't see how anything else could happen, that things had a way of settling</div>
<div id="td_273" class="t s1_273">down, and after enough time passed people would forget that Tom Robinson's</div>
<div id="te_273" class="t s1_273">existence was ever brought to their attention.</div>
<div id="tf_273" class="t s1_273">Perhaps Atticus was right, but the events of the summer hung over us like smoke in</div>
<div id="tg_273" class="t s1_273">a closed room. The adults in Maycomb never discussed the case with Jemand me;</div>
<div id="th_273" class="t s1_273">it seemed that they discussed it with their children, and their attitude must have</div>
<div id="ti_273" class="t s1_273">been that neither of us could help having Atticus for a parent, so their children</div>
<div id="tj_273" class="t s1_273">must be nice to us in spite of him. The children would never have thought that up</div>
<div id="tk_273" class="t s1_273">for themselves: had our classmates been left to their own devices, Jem and I</div>
<div id="tl_273" class="t s1_273">would have had several swift, satisfying fist-fights apiece and ended the matter for</div>
<div id="tm_273" class="t s1_273">good. As it was, we were compelled to hold our heads highand be, respectively,</div>
<div id="tn_273" class="t s1_273">a gentleman and a lady. In a way, it was like the era of Mrs. Henry Lafayette</div>
<div id="to_273" class="t s1_273">Dubose, without all her yelling. There was one odd thing, though, that I never</div>
<div id="tp_273" class="t s1_273">understood: in spite of Atticus's shortcomings as a parent, people were content to</div>
<div id="tq_273" class="t s1_273">re-elect him to the state legislature that year, as usual, without opposition. I came</div>
<div id="tr_273" class="t s1_273">to the conclusion that people were just peculiar, I withdrew from them, and never</div>
<div id="ts_273" class="t s1_273">thought about them until I was forced to.</div>
<div id="tt_273" class="t s1_273">I was forced to one day in school. Once a week, we had a Current Events period.</div>
<div id="tu_273" class="t s1_273">Each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents,</div>
<div id="tv_273" class="t s1_273">and reveal them to the class. This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils:</div>
<div id="tw_273" class="t s1_273">standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise;</div>
<div id="tx_273" class="t s1_273">delivering a short talk made him word-conscious; learning his current event</div>
<div id="ty_273" class="t s1_273">strengthened his memory; being singled out made him more than ever anxious to</div>
<div id="tz_273" class="t s1_273">return to the Group.</div>
